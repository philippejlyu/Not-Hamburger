# Object-Recognizer
A program that I made using CoreML that will allows you to recognize items using machine learning libraries.
## Setup
You need to download the Core ML model from [this link](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/coreml/models/VGG16.mlmodel).
The library is the VGG16 Machine Learning library. You need to use Xcode 9+ and iOS 11 in order to run this code properly
