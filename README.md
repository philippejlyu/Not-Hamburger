# Not Hamburger
A program that I made using CoreML that will allows you to recognize items using machine learning libraries.
It originally started out as an object recognizer to test out the capabilities of the VGG16 model paired with CoreML, but became a hamburger recognizer when my friend asked me if I could make one.
## Setup
You need to download the Core ML model from [this link](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/coreml/models/VGG16.mlmodel).
The library is the VGG16 Machine Learning library. You need to add the file to the Xcode project. Make sure it is added as a target or else it will not work. You need to use Xcode 9+ and iOS 11 in order to run this code properly
